Tool for cutting velcro - our latest and greatest in finger removing technology

Pretty simple hardware wise (complete lies), you only need a few other (lie) parts apart from a few (lie) the 3D printed parts:
* Arduino Leonardo
* Two MG995 or One MG995 and One DS3218MG
* One Encoder without a button (i used KLS4-EC1101-5A-F20) and one Encoder module with a button (like whatever adafruit sells)
* 


# TODO/Issues

1) Fix feeding issues, oh yeah the velcro is not feeding properly rn :)

2) Add a casing for electronics, it would be nice to not hold the mess of wires in my hands

3) Make a PCB hat for the arduino its based on, and maybe add an proper LDO to it, the wires are a fucking mess and i hate them

4) Make the servo mounts fit the servos a bit less tight? They are almost impossible to slot into the mounts without a hammer rn
